## Objective
This Power BI project aims to analyze and compare data from seven major car manufacturers—Volkswagen, BMW, Audi, Hyundai, Toyota, Skoda, and Ford—across several key parameters such as car models, transmission types, fuel types, average prices, average mileage, and more. The project provides insights into how these factors vary across different car brands, and how each manufacturer stands in terms of vehicle specifications and overall trends in the automobile industry.

The goal is to enable users to interactively explore data, make comparisons across brands and models, and uncover meaningful insights related to the automotive market.

## Key Parameters Analyzed
The analysis focuses on several key parameters that allow for detailed comparison between different car manufacturers:

Car Model: Different models produced by each car manufacturer.
Transmission Type: Automatic or manual transmission.
Fuel Type: Petrol, diesel, hybrid, or electric.
Year of Manufacturing: The year each car model was manufactured.
Average Price: The average market price for each vehicle model.
Average Mileage: The average distance a car can travel per unit of fuel.
Average MPG (Miles Per Gallon): A measure of fuel efficiency for each model.
Average Tax: Average tax applied to cars, based on their value or emissions.

## Tools and Technologies Used
Microsoft Power BI Desktop: For creating interactive visualizations, dashboards, and reports.
Power Query: For data cleaning, transformation, and integration.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For calculating custom metrics like average price, average mileage, and MPG.
Excel: Used for preprocessing and initial cleaning of datasets.
Open Data Sources: Data collected from various open sources including Google and official car manufacturers' sales data.

## Data Transformation and Techniques
1. Data Collection:
Datasets were collected from various open sources, including Google and public sales data from car manufacturers. The data covers vehicle specifications, including model details, price, mileage, fuel type, and more.
2. Data Cleaning:
Data inconsistencies and duplicates were addressed using Power Query.
Missing values were handled appropriately, ensuring the dataset was ready for analysis.
3. Data Transformation:
Data was transformed to fit into a structured model, including the calculation of averages (e.g., average price, average mileage) using DAX.
Merged datasets from different manufacturers and connected related tables for seamless analysis.
4. Data Integration:
Integrated multiple datasets, including car models and their corresponding data on price, mileage, and other specifications, into a unified dataset for comparison.
5. Visualizations:
Interactive dashboards were created to allow users to filter data by car manufacturer, model, transmission type, fuel type, and other relevant parameters.
Bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts were used to visualize relationships between car specifications and other attributes like price, MPG, and tax.
Created scatter plots to compare price against mileage and MPG, helping identify correlations between vehicle cost and fuel efficiency.

## Insights and Key Findings
1. Fuel Efficiency Trends:
Cars with hybrid or electric fuel types generally showed better fuel efficiency, with BMW and Audi leading in this category with some of the highest MPG figures.
Toyota led in terms of offering a wide range of fuel-efficient models, particularly in the hybrid segment.
2. Price vs. Mileage:
There is a noticeable trend where luxury brands like BMW and Audi tend to have higher average prices, but this does not always correlate with higher mileage.
Hyundai and Skoda provided vehicles with competitive pricing, along with decent mileage, making them attractive options for budget-conscious buyers.
3. Transmission and Fuel Type Preferences:
Automatic transmission cars were more common across all manufacturers, with some exceptions in specific models from Volkswagen and Ford.
Diesel cars were predominantly produced by Volkswagen and Skoda, especially in older models, while newer models from Audi and BMW focused on electric and hybrid fuel types.
4. Tax Analysis:
Luxury vehicles like those from BMW and Audi generally had higher tax rates compared to budget-friendly options like Hyundai and Ford.
Toyota had a mix of both high-end and budget-friendly models, resulting in a balanced average tax rate across their vehicles.
